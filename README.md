# Ruby on Rails tutorial: first 3.2.2 app

About a month ago I started to read and follow the 
ruby on Rails Tutorial "learning by example", and I liked it a lot.
Because It tought a programming culture that made sense and felt very solid.
Now I am doing my second turn, with the second edition, and Rails 3.2.2
